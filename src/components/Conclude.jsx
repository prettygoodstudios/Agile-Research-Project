        <p>Agile is a management philosophy and methodology that when properly and appropriately implemented can make an organization more nimble and can eliminate wasteful processes. Agile indeed provides legitimate value to the organizations and individuals who implement it. Infact I was personally able to implement Agile principles and values to develop this website in a time effective manner.</p>
